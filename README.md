An all-in-one interactive web platform designed to centralize, manage, and promote college events, connecting students, college authorities, and event coordinators for seamless participation and administration.

### Short Description / Purpose
EventVerse serves as a centralized hub for college students and teachers to gather and discover all college events in one location. Its primary goal is to democratize access to technical education and opportunities by providing a platform where colleges can promote their events widely, and students can easily discover and participate in learning opportunities beyond their campus.

### Tech Stack
💻 **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** – Core frontend development for a visually appealing and responsive user interface
✨ **PHP (Backend)** – Server-side scripting for handling dynamic data, user authentication, and administrative logic
🎨 **Custom Styling & Dark Mode UI** – Modern, dark-themed design for an engaging user experience
🤖 **AI Tool** – Utilized for project development and potentially content generation or feature enhancement

### Key Features
🏛️ **Centralized Event Discovery** – Students can explore all upcoming and past events from various colleges in one place.
✅ **Admin Panel** – A dedicated dashboard for college authorities to manage events, participants, and users. Features include user profile management, event listing controls, and participant tracking.
👥 **Participant Management** – Detailed administration view for tracking participant teams, including college names, contact information, and payment status (e.g., Payment Pending).
🗓️ **Upcoming Event Countdown** – Features a real-time countdown function to the next scheduled event.
👤 **Profile Management** – Secure section for Admin users to manage and update their account information and credentials.
🌐 **Wide College Network** – Platform built to support a large network of events and colleges, aiming for high user and institution participation.

### Data Source

➡️ **Platform Analytics** – Aggregates data on listed events, participating colleges, and active users to showcase the platform's reach.

### Features / Highlights
**Business Problem**
Students often miss out on valuable college events due to scattered information across different college websites and platforms. Event organizers lack a single, large platform to promote their events to a wider, interested audience.

**Goal of the Project**
To create an efficient, transparent, and centralized event management and discovery platform that increases student participation in technical and learning events while simplifying the administrative process for college coordinators.
